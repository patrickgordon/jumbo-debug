# Jumbo Debug
This chrome extension aims to provide an easy way for developers and non-developers to debug a Powered by Jumbo website.

## Features

### Translate Debug
When activated, it will show the translate key being used in a given location.

This is currently limited as it will not support Heading or List items. Hopefully those can be inferred from context.
